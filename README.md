# WEB-RESUME
## WHAT IS THIS?
This is a proof of concept (POC) of a larger web application project I'm currently working on. This repository hosts a static web page that displays a web version of a resume. The resume's data is provided in ./store/data.js.

## HOW CAN YOU USE THIS REPOSITORY'S SOURCE CODE?
You can download the source code, clone the repo, or fork it. The UI is independent of the data within data.js. To make it you own, replace with your own resume data.
