# WEB-RESUME: Cooler than Your PDF Resume, and Can Become a PDF!

This glorious repository holds the code for a **proof-of-concept** (fancy way of saying "experiment") web application as part of a larger web application project I am currently working on. It's basically a digital billboard for your awesomeness, but way more interactive than a static resume doc.

## What's in the box?

### A **static web page** that showcases your resume in all its web-ified glory. 
### A data file (`./store/data.js`) that feeds all the juicy details about your experience and skills. 

## Can I play with it?

Absolutely! You have three options, choose your fighter:

1. **Download the Source Code:** Grab the code, tinker with it, and unleash your inner web development wizard.
2. **Clone the Repo:** Fancy a copy you can call your own? Clone this bad boy and make it shine.
3. **Fork it!:** Feeling collaborative? Fork it, tweak it, and maybe even send a pull request our way (we won't judge... much).

## But wait, there's more!

The best part? The UI (fancy word for the pretty bits you see) is separate from the data. So, swap out the info in `data.js` with your own resume details, and voila! You've got yourself a personalized web resume that screams "hire me!"

**P.S.** We won't tell if you use some inspirational elements from this project. Sharing is caring, after all.
